# Amazon User Segmentation
We designed a project on how Amazon segmented the users by using the K Algorithm.
here we are using K means cluster.
Everyone have unique homepage in amazon.com because they uses their last or previous data to next how your homepage visible.
First thing i choose k algorithm and before lets know whats this algorithm is,
steps to be followed :-

step 1 :- We need to decide no of clusters k, for this we have a formula WCSS(defined as the sum of the square distance between each member if cluster and its centroid) and plotting this we will get a graph and the following elbow method we find the optimal K(clusters).

step 2 :- At random points select K the centroids (may not be from your dataset).

step 3 :- Assign data point to the closest centroid.

step 4 :- Place the new centroid of each cluster after completing.

step 5 :- Reassign each data point to the new closest centroid if any reassignment took place go to step 4 otherwise go to FIN then your model is ready based on this algorithm we have designed the project.

In this project we took Annual income and ratings as parameters for clustering if you want you would take more parameters for clustering..
And also this algorithm works for searching too.

Amazon uses intelligent user segmentation which allows to give information about the type of users spending time on the platform. Traditionally, user segmentation has relied on demographic information and manually curated business rules to make assumptions about users intentions and assign them to pre-defined audience segments. Amazon uses machine learning techniques to learn about your items, users, and how your users interact with your items. Amazon Personalize segments users based on their preferences for different products, categories, brands, and more.
